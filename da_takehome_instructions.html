<h1>Fetch - Data Analyst Take Home</h1>
<h2>In this exercise you will:</h2>
<h4>Demonstrate how you reason about data and how you communicate your understanding of a specific data set to others.</h4>

<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<h4>The exercise must be committed to a git repository and the link must be provided to the recruiter. Emailed files will not be reviewed.</h4>

<h2>Tips:</h2>
<ul>	<li>Communicate your thoughts in each section. Code should be commented. Findings and conclusions should be written down and shared.</li>
	<li>Share assumptions you are making.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exercise:</h2>

<h3>First: explore the data</h3>
<h4>Review the unstructured csv files and answer the following questions with code that supports your conclusions:</h4>
<ul><li>Are there any data quality issues present?</li>
	<li>Are there any fields that are challenging to understand?</li>
</ul>
<h4>We recommend using SQL or python and data visualization to examine the data.</h4>

<h3>Second: provide SQL queries</h3>
<h4>Answer three of the following questions with at least one question coming from the closed-ended and one from the open-ended question set. Each question should be answered using one query.
</h4>
<h4>Closed-ended questions:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned among users 21 and over?</li>
	<li>What are the top 5 brands by sales among users that have had their account for at least six months?</li>
	<li>What is the percentage of sales in the Health & Wellness category by generation?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Open-ended questions: for these, make assumptions and clearly state them when answering the question.</h4>
<ul>

	<li>Who are Fetch&rsquo;s power users?</li>
	<li>Which is the leading brand in the Dips & Salsa category?</li>
	<li>At what percent has Fetch grown year over year?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Third: communicate with stakeholders</h3>
<h4>Construct an email or slack message that is understandable to a product or business leader who is not familiar with your day-to-day work. Summarize the results of your investigation. Include:
</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Key data quality issues and outstanding questions about the data</li>
	<li>One interesting trend in the data
		<ul><li>Use a finding from part 2 or come up with a new insight</li></ul>
<li>Request for action: explain what additional help, info, etc. you need to make sense of the data and resolve any outstanding issues</li>
</ul>
